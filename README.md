# Handwriting.io Client

TODO Links and Badges

## Installation

TODO Gem install command

## Basic Example

Set up a client and list multiple pages of available handwritings:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'handwritingio'

# These credentials are for a test key
# Set up your own keys at https://www.handwriting.io
key = '9V46FJ4J2T7HKEY6'
secret = '011WCJ8ZTFV4TATF'

client = Handwritingio::Client.with_credentials(key, secret)
handwritings = []
limit = 50
offset = 0
page = client.handwritings(limit: limit, offset: offset)
page_count = 1
until page.empty?
  handwritings += page
  offset += limit
  page = client.handwritings(limit: limit, offset: offset)
  page_count += 1
end

puts "#{handwritings.count} handwritings listed in #{page_count} pages"
```

The output should look like this:

```
> ruby examples/list_all_handwritings.rb
203 handwritings listed in 6 pages
```

Set up the client, render an image, and write it to a file:

```ruby
require 'pathname'
require 'tmpdir'

require 'rubygems'
require 'handwritingio'

# These credentials are for a test key
# Set up your own keys at https://www.handwriting.io
key = '9V46FJ4J2T7HKEY6'
secret = '011WCJ8ZTFV4TATF'

Dear Lauren and Steve,

  Thank you so much for the thoughtful wedding gift. We were looking at crystal wine glasses just the other week. Hope you have a good trip with the family and hope to see you when you get back!

    All the best,

client = Handwritingio::Client.with_credentials(key, secret)

# Dimensions here are a typical 1080p display
png = client.render_png(text: thank_you, handwriting_id: '5WGWVX9800WC', width: '1920px', height: '1080px', handwriting_size: '40px')
pathname = Pathname.new(Dir.tmpdir) + 'handwriting.png'
bytes = pathname.write(png)
puts "#{bytes} written to #{pathname}"

# Dimensions here are a typical 8 1/2 x 11 inch sheet of paper
pdf = client.render_pdf(text: thank_you, handwriting_id: '5WGWVX9800WC', width: '8.5in', height: '11in', handwriting_size: '24pt')
pathname = Pathname.new(Dir.tmpdir) + 'handwriting.pdf'
bytes = pathname.write(pdf)
puts "#{bytes} written to #{pathname}"
```

The output should look like this:
```
> ruby examples/simple_render_png.rb
103262 written to /tmp/handwriting.png
643577 written to /tmp/handwriting.pdf
```

The images written should look like these:

[handwriting.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hwio-cdn-production/ruby-client/handwriting.png)

[handwriting.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hwio-cdn-production/ruby-client/handwriting.pdf)

## Advanced Examples

Overlaying handwriting on a background image:

```ruby
# TODO Example Code
```

It should create an image like this : [handwriting_overlay.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hwio-cdn-production/ruby-client/handwriting_overlay.png)

## Reference

See the [API Documentation](https://www.handwriting.io/docs) for details on all endpoints and parameters. For the most part, the Client passes parameters through to the API directly.

The endpoints map to client methods as follows:

- [GET /handwritings](https://handwriting.io/docs/#get-handwritings) -> `Client#handwritings(params)`
- [GET /handwritings/{id}](https://handwriting.io/docs/#get-handwritings--id-) -> `Client#handwriting(handwriting_id)`
- [GET /render/png](https://handwriting.io/docs/#get-render-png) -> `Client#render_png(params)`
- [GET /render/pdf](https://handwriting.io/docs/#get-render-pdf) -> `Client#render_pdf(params)`

## Version Numbers

Version numbers for this package work slightly differently than standard
[semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). For this package, the `major`
version number will match the Handwriting.io API version number, and the
`minor` version will be  incremented for any breaking changes to this package.
The `patch` version will be incremented for bug fixes and changes that add
functionality only.
